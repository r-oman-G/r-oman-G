### Hi there 👋 I’m Roman

📱 I’m a mobile developer with 7+ years of experience in native Android (Java/Kotlin) and Flutter, with additional experience in iOS (Swift).

🤖 I work across platforms, building robust mobile apps with clean architecture, high performance, and production readiness.

🌐 I also have strong experience in Web3 mobile development, including crypto wallets, blockchain integration (Solana, Ethereum), secure key management, and dApp interaction through in-app browsers.

🚀 In my free time, I create side projects that help me explore new technologies, refine my skills, and stay sharp.
